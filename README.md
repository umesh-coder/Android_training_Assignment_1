Do you watch the IPL?

Let’s build our own system for managing the IPL tournament.

Write a Java program (with Class Diagram), and develop a system for managing cricket tournament such that,
There can be up to 10 teams participating in the tournament (similar to in the IPL)
Tournament is T20 format
Each team is assigned an unique home ground (venue)
Every cricket match is played between two teams only
Every team will have 12 players including the impact player in the playing squad
System should record stats/performance of every player for each match
It should have the ability to maintain the scoreboard with points, ranking for every team

Now today, extend the existing functionality and provide support for below functionality:
Make adjustments in your codebase to now handle all the tournament type like IPL, T20 WorldCup, ODI WorldCup, World Test Campionship, etc
Match format type can be T20, ODI, Test matches
There will 12 players only in IPL tournament, but 11 players in all other tournament type


Feel free to assume things as you go along!

The system should be able to answer global stats queries like, “Who is the highest wicket taker of all time?”, “Who has scored maximum numbers of 50s?

List out the teams who went to semi-finals?
List out top 5 run scorers in the complete tournament?
Program should print the winner of the tournament


Input:
Who is the highest wicket taker of all time?

Output:
Player Name
No of wickets

Point to note:
Design Class Diagram
Follow OOP + SOLID Best practices, Exception Handling, Collection Framework, etc
Develop Java code following modularity, reusability, maintainability, scalability
Document your thought process
